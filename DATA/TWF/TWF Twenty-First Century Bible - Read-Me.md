The "Twenty-First Century Version" of the bible is a new paraphrased Bible version that is actively being worked on. It's being translated from many different ancient text sources. The paraphrased translation is being rewritten by humans with human oversight, with the help of AI Artificial Intelligence. There are many books and chapters that are in need of translation and paraphrasing. If you would like to contribute to this effort, please fork this project. The only files that will be used for translating and paraphrasing will be the TWF.db file in the TWF folder.

The main TWF.db database file can be edited with "DB Browser for SQLite" for Windows which is explained on the <a href="../../Readme.md">Readme.md</a> page in the main folder.
