Use This Code With Caution:
Share a Webpage from the Browser:
If the browser supports the navigator.share() function, it can be used to bring up a menu screen to pick an app to share a link with. This is known as a share sheet. The share sheet is a system provided dialog that lists all of the apps on the user's device that can handle the shared data. The user can then select the app that they want to share the data with. Most modern browsers support share sheets, but some older browsers may not. Additionally, some users may have disabled share sheets in their device's settings. If the navigator.share() function does not bring up a share sheet, then the user can still share the data by copying and pasting the link into the app that they want to share it with.

JavaScript Example:
const shareData = {
  title: 'My Share Title',
  url: 'https://example.com',
};
navigator.share(shareData);
