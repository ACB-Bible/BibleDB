It contains a public domain version of the Jewish scriptures that does not include the new testament. The JPSVerses.txt machine readable text file is the only available file format at this time. The other data formats for the JPS version are not currently available. The JPS version uses a different verse structure than the Christian bible, and will require different file handling techniques. There is no accurate verse count for the JPS version yet. It is also not included in the two example code projects below.

##### How to Use the BibleDB Project:
The BibleDB Project contains many different public Domain versions of the Bible, in many different formats. These Bible versions are located under the DATA flder, and each version is organized in a folder using its popular title abreviation as the title of the folder. The file types in these folders include SQLite3.db, plain text, Json, Jsonc, and a Javascript array file.

"DB Browser for SQLite" for Windows is a graphical user interface(GUI) editor that can be used to edit SQLite3 database files that uses a point and click graphical user interface, and it can be installed from the Microsoft Store. You can also install NodeJS to debug, test, and run the .js Javascript files. You can use VSCode, which is an open source code Integrated Development Environment(IDE) to edit the code.

1. Microsoft Store:

There are two other projects that use the datafiles for an online bible. Both of these projects contain open source code that you can use for free. Each project has the complete source code that can be altered, or used as is to build your own online bible.
