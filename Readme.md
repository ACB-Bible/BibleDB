 * The JPS Jewish Publication Society's Tanakh 1917 Old Testament version of the bile is not a Christian bible, but it is included as a reference for scholars and theogians to study. It contains a public domain version of the Jewish scriptures that does not include the new testament. The JPSVerses.txt machine readable text file is the only available file format at this time. The other data formats for the JPS version are not currently available. The JPS version uses a different verse structure than the Christian bible, and will require different file handling techniques. There is no accurate verse count for the JPS version yet. It is also not included in the two example code projects below.

The BibleDB Project contains many different public Domain versions of the Bible, in many different formats. These Bible versions are located under the DATA flder, and each version is organized in a folder using its popular title abreviation as the title of the folder. The file types in these folders include SQLite3.db, plain text, Json, Jsonc, and a Javascript array file.

"DB Browser for SQLite" for Windows is a graphical user interface(GUI) editor that can be used to edit SQLite3 database files that uses a point and click graphical user interface, and it can be installed from the Microsoft Store. You can also install NodeJS to debug, test, and run the .js Javascript files. You can use VSCode, which is an open source code Integrated Development Environment(IDE) to edit the code.

1. Microsoft Store:
